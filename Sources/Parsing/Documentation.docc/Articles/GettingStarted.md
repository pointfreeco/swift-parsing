## Your first parser

Suppose you have a string that holds some user data that you want to parse into an array of `User`s:

```swift
var input = """
1,Blob,true
2,Blob Jr.,false
3,Blob Sr.,true
"""

struct User {
  var id: Int
  var name: String
  var isAdmin: Bool
}
```

A naive approach to this would be a nested use of `.split(separator:)`, and then a little bit of 
extra work to convert strings into integers and booleans:

```swift
let users = input
  .split(separator: "\n")
  .compactMap { row -> User? in
    let fields = row.split(separator: ",")
    guard
      fields.count == 3,
      let id = Int(fields[0]),
      let isAdmin = Bool(String(fields[2]))
    else { return nil }

    return User(id: id, name: String(fields[1]), isAdmin: isAdmin)
  }
```

Not only is this code a little messy, but it is also inefficient since we are allocating arrays for 
the `.split` and then just immediately throwing away those values.

It would be more straightforward and efficient to instead describe how to consume bits from the 
beginning of the input and convert that into users. This is what this parser library excels at ðŸ˜„.

We can start by describing what it means to parse a single row, first by parsing an integer off the 
front of the string, and then parsing a comma. We can do this by using the `Parse` type, which acts 
as an entry point into describing a list of parsers that you want to run one after the other to 
consume from an input:

```swift
let user = Parse {
  Int.parser()
  ","
}
```

Already this can consume the beginning of the input:

```swift
// Use a mutable substring to verify what is consumed
var input = input[...]

try user.parse(&input)  // 1
input                   // "Blob,true\n2,Blob Jr.,false\n3,Blob Sr.,true"
```

Next we want to take everything up until the next comma for the user's name, and then consume the 
comma:

```swift
let user = Parse { 
  Int.parser()
  ","
  Prefix { $0 != "," }
  ","
}
```

And then we want to take the boolean at the end of the row for the user's admin status:

```swift
let user = Parse {
  Int.parser()
  ","
  Prefix { $0 != "," }
  ","
  Bool.parser()
}
```

Currently this will parse a tuple `(Int, Substring, Bool)` from the input, and we can `.map` on 
that to turn it into a `User`:

```swift
let user = Parse {
  Int.parser()
  ","
  Prefix { $0 != "," }
  ","
  Bool.parser()
}
.map { User(id: $0, name: String($1), isAdmin: $2) }
```

To make the data we are parsing to more prominent, we can instead pass the transform closure as the
first argument to `Parse`:

```swift
let user = Parse {
  User(id: $0, name: String($1), isAdmin: $2)
} with: {
  Int.parser()
  ","
  Prefix { $0 != "," }
  ","
  Bool.parser()
}
```

Or we can pass the `User` initializer to `Parse` in a point-free style by transforming the `Prefix` 
parser's output from a `Substring` to ` String` first:

```swift
let user = Parse(User.init(id:name:isAdmin:)) {
  Int.parser()
  ","
  Prefix { $0 != "," }.map(String.init)
  ","
  Bool.parser()
}
```

That is enough to parse a single user from the input string, leaving behind a newline and the final 
two users:

```swift
try user.parse(&input)  // User(id: 1, name: "Blob", isAdmin: true)
input                   // "\n2,Blob Jr.,false\n3,Blob Sr.,true"
```

To parse multiple users from the input we can use the `Many` parser to run the user parser many 
times:

```swift
let users = Many {
  user
} separator: {
  "\n"
}

try users.parse(&input)  // [User(id: 1, name: "Blob", isAdmin: true), ...]
input                    // ""
```

Now this parser can process an entire document of users, and the code is simpler and more 
straightforward than the version that uses `.split` and `.compactMap`.

Even better, it's more performant. We've written 
[benchmarks][benchmarks-readme] for these two styles of parsing, 
and the `.split`-style of parsing is more than twice as slow:

```
name                             time        std        iterations
------------------------------------------------------------------
README Example.Parser: Substring 3426.000 ns Â±  63.40 %     385395
README Example.Ad hoc            7631.000 ns Â±  47.01 %     169332
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

Further, if you are willing write your parsers against `UTF8View` instead of `Substring`, you can 
eke out even more performance, more than doubling the speed:

```
name                             time        std        iterations
------------------------------------------------------------------
README Example.Parser: Substring 3693.000 ns Â±  81.76 %     349763
README Example.Parser: UTF8      1272.000 ns Â± 128.16 %     999150
README Example.Ad hoc            8504.000 ns Â±  59.59 %     151417
```

We can also compare these times to a tool that Apple's Foundation gives us: `Scanner`. It's a type 
that allows you to consume from the beginning of strings in order to produce values, and provides 
a nicer API than using `.split`:

```swift
var users: [User] = []
while scanner.currentIndex != input.endIndex {
  guard
    let id = scanner.scanInt(),
    let _ = scanner.scanString(","),
    let name = scanner.scanUpToString(","),
    let _ = scanner.scanString(","),
    let isAdmin = scanner.scanBool()
  else { break }

  users.append(User(id: id, name: name, isAdmin: isAdmin))
  _ = scanner.scanString("\n")
}
```

However, the `Scanner` style of parsing is more than 5 times as slow as the substring parser 
written above, and more than 15 times slower than the UTF-8 parser:

```
name                             time         std        iterations
-------------------------------------------------------------------
README Example.Parser: Substring  3481.000 ns Â±  65.04 %     376525
README Example.Parser: UTF8       1207.000 ns Â± 110.96 %    1000000
README Example.Ad hoc             8029.000 ns Â±  44.44 %     163719
README Example.Scanner           19786.000 ns Â±  35.26 %      62125
```

That's the basics of parsing a simple string format, but there's a lot more operators and tricks to 
learn in order to performantly parse larger inputs. View the 
[benchmarks][benchmarks] for examples of real life parsing scenarios.
