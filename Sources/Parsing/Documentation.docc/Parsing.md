# ``Parsing``

A library for turning nebulous data into well-structured data, with a focus on composition, 
performance, generality, and ergonomics.

## Overview

Parsing with this library is performed by listing out many small parsers that describe how to 
incremental consume small bits from the beginning of an input string. For example, suppose you have 
a string that holds some user data that you want to parse into an array of `User`s:

```swift
var input = """
1,Blob,true
2,Blob Jr.,false
3,Blob Sr.,true
"""

struct User {
  var id: Int
  var name: String
  var isAdmin: Bool
}
```

A parser can be constructed for transforming the input string into an array of users in succinct 
and fluent API:

```swift
let user = Parse(User.init(id:name:isAdmin:)) {
  Int.parser()
  ","
  Prefix { $0 != "," }.map(String.init)
  ","
  Bool.parser()
}

let users = Many {
  user
} separator: {
  "\n"
} terminator: { 
  End()
}

try users.parse(&input)  // [User(id: 1, name: "Blob", isAdmin: true), ...]
input                    // ""
```

This says that to parse a user we consume an integer from the beginning of the input, then a comma, 
then everything up to the next comma, then another comma, and finally a boolean. And to parse an 
entire array of users we run the `user` parser many times and between each invocation we run the 
separator parser, which consumes a newline, and once the `user` parser has consumed all it can we 
run the `terminator` parser, which verifies that there is no more input to consume.

Further, if the input is malformed, like say we mistyped one of the booleans, then the parser emits 
an error that describes exactly what went wrong:

```swift
var input = """
1,Blob,true
2,Blob Jr.,false
3,Blob Sr.,tru
"""[...]

try users.parse(&input)

// error: unexpected input
//  --> input:3:11
// 3 | 3,Blob Jr,tru
//   |           ^ expected "true" or "false"
```

That's the basics of parsing a simple string format, but there's a lot more operators and tricks to 
learn in order to performantly parse larger inputs.
