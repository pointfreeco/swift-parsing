/// Declares a type that can parse an `Input` value into an `Output` value.
///
/// A parser attempts to parse a nebulous piece of data, represented by the `Input` associated type,
/// into something more well-structured, represented by the `Output` associated type. The parser
/// implements the ``parse(_:)-76tcw`` method, which is handed an `inout Input`, and its job is to
/// turn this into an `Output` if possible, or throw an error if it cannot.
///
/// The argument of the ``parse(_:)-76tcw`` function is `inout` because a parser will usually
/// consume some of the input in order to produce an output. For example, we can use an
/// `Int.parser()` parser to extract an integer from the beginning of a substring and consume that
/// portion of the string:
///
/// ```swift
/// var input: Substring = "123 Hello world"
///
/// try Int.parser().parse(&input) // 123
/// input // " Hello world"
/// ```
///
/// Note that this parser works on `Substring` rather than `String` because substrings expose
/// efficient ways of removing characters from its beginning. Substrings are "views" into a string,
/// specificed by start and end indices. Operations like `removeFirst`, `removeLast` and others can
/// be implemented efficiently on substrings because they simply move the start and end indices,
/// whereas their implementation on strings must make a copy of the string with the characters
/// removed.
///

///

/// * <doc:Design>
/// * <doc:StringAbstractions>
